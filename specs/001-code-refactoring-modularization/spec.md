# Feature Specification: Code Refactoring and Modularization

## Overview
Refactor the agentic-ticker codebase to eliminate code duplication and improve modularity by extracting common patterns into reusable utilities and decorators.

## User Stories

### As a developer, I want to:
- Eliminate repetitive code patterns across multiple files
- Extract common functionality into reusable utility modules
- Implement decorators for cross-cutting concerns like error handling
- Improve code maintainability and testability
- Reduce the overall codebase size while maintaining functionality

### As a maintainer, I want to:
- Have centralized configuration management
- Consistent error handling patterns across the codebase
- Better separation of concerns between different modules
- Easier onboarding for new developers

## Functional Requirements

- **FR2.7**: Create `config.py` for configuration management utilities

### 3. Decorator Implementation
- **FR3.1**: Implement `@handle_api_errors` decorator for standardized error handling
- **FR3.2**: Implement `@with_event_reporting` decorator for event reporting
