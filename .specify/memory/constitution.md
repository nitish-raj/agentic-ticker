# Agentic Ticker Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality Excellence
All code MUST adhere to strict quality standards: linting and type checking MUST pass; Code MUST be readable, maintainable, and follow established patterns; Security vulnerabilities MUST be addressed immediately; Documentation MUST be kept current and accurate

### Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing is NON-NEGOTIABLE: Unit tests MUST cover all critical paths; Integration tests MUST validate component interactions; Contract tests MUST ensure API compatibility; Test coverage MUST be monitored and maintained above 80%; All tests MUST run in CI/CD pipeline

### User Experience Consistency
User interfaces MUST follow consistent patterns: All interactions MUST be intuitive and predictable; Error messages MUST be clear and actionable; Response times MUST meet user expectations; Accessibility standards MUST be followed; Design system components MUST be used consistently

### Performance Requirements
Performance targets MUST be strictly enforced: API responses MUST complete within 200ms p95; Database queries MUST be optimized and indexed; Memory usage MUST remain within defined limits; Throughput MUST meet scalability requirements; Performance MUST be monitored and alerts configured

## Development Workflow

Feature-driven development with spec → plan → tasks → implementation flow; All features must follow the constitutional process; Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process

## Quality Standards

All code must pass linting and type checking; Performance targets must be met (<200ms p95 response time); Security compliance required; Documentation must be kept current

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use agent-specific guidance files for runtime development
