# Data Model: Code Refactoring and Modularization

## Entity Overview
This document outlines the data models and entities involved in the code refactoring and modularization feature.

## Core Entities

### 1. UtilityModule
Represents a utility module that will be created to house common functionality.

**Fields**:
- `name` (string): Name of the utility module (e.g., "gemini_api", "search_utils")
- `description` (string): Purpose and scope of the module
- `functions` (array[UtilityFunction]): List of utility functions in the module
- `dependencies` (array[string]): External dependencies required by the module
- `file_path` (string): Relative path where the module will be created

**Validation Rules**:

- `solution_approach` (string): Approach for eliminating this duplication

**Validation Rules**:
- `pattern_id` must be unique
- `lines_affected` must be a positive integer
- `priority` must be one of the predefined priority levels

### 5. CodeLocation
Represents a specific location in the codebase where duplication occurs.

**Fields**:
- `file_path` (string): Absolute path to the file
- `start_line` (integer): Starting line number of the duplicated code
- `end_line` (integer): Ending line number of the duplicated code
- `function_name` (string): Name of the function containing the duplication (if applicable)

**Validation Rules**:
- `file_path` must be an absolute path within the repository
- `start_line` must be less than or equal to `end_line`
- Both line numbers must be positive integers

## Relationships

### Module-Function Relationship
Each `UtilityModule` contains multiple `UtilityFunction` entities. This is a one-to-many relationship where the module acts as a container for related utility functions.

### Function-Duplication Relationship
Each `UtilityFunction` addresses one or more `CodeDuplicationPattern` entities. This represents which utility functions eliminate which duplication patterns.

### Decorator-Function Relationship
Each `Decorator` can be applied to multiple `UtilityFunction` entities. This represents cross-cutting concerns that apply across different utility functions.

### Pattern-Location Relationship
Each `CodeDuplicationPattern` has multiple `CodeLocation` entities. This shows where in the codebase each duplication pattern occurs.

## State Transitions

### Refactoring State Machine
The refactoring process follows these states:

1. **ANALYSIS_COMPLETE**: Initial state after code analysis
2. **UTILITIES_CREATED**: Utility modules have been created
3. **DECORATORS_IMPLEMENTED**: Decorators have been implemented
4. **DUPLICATION_ELIMINATED**: Code duplication has been eliminated
5. **TESTS_UPDATED**: Tests have been updated to cover new utilities
6. **VALIDATION_COMPLETE**: All validation checks have passed

### State Transition Rules
- **ANALYSIS_COMPLETE** → **UTILITIES_CREATED**: When all utility modules are created
- **UTILITIES_CREATED** → **DECORATORS_IMPLEMENTED**: When all decorators are implemented
- **DECORATORS_IMPLEMENTED** → **DUPLICATION_ELIMINATED**: When duplicated code is replaced with utility calls
- **DUPLICATION_ELIMINATED** → **TESTS_UPDATED**: When tests are updated for new utilities
- **TESTS_UPDATED** → **VALIDATION_COMPLETE**: When all validation passes

## Data Validation

### Input Validation
All utility functions must validate their inputs according to these rules:
- String inputs must not be empty or None (unless explicitly allowed)
- Numeric inputs must be within expected ranges
- List/dict inputs must have expected structure
- File paths must be valid and accessible

### Output Validation
All utility functions must ensure their outputs:
- Match the declared return type
- Are properly formatted and structured
- Handle edge cases appropriately
- Are consistent across multiple calls

### Error Handling
All utility functions must:
- Validate inputs before processing
- Handle expected exceptions gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Fail safely without data corruption

## Configuration

### Module Configuration
Each utility module can have configuration parameters:
- `enabled` (boolean): Whether the module is active
- `debug_mode` (boolean): Whether debug logging is enabled
- `performance_tracking` (boolean): Whether performance metrics are collected
- `cache_enabled` (boolean): Whether caching is enabled for expensive operations

### Decorator Configuration
Each decorator can have configuration parameters:
- `enabled` (boolean): Whether the decorator is active
- `log_level` (string): Logging level for the decorator
- `retry_count` (integer): Number of retries for retry decorators
- `timeout` (integer): Timeout in milliseconds for time-sensitive operations

## Persistence

### Module Persistence
Utility modules are persisted as Python files in the src/ directory:
- File names follow snake_case convention (e.g., `gemini_api.py`)
- Each module contains related utility functions
- Modules are imported and used by the main application

### Configuration Persistence
Configuration is persisted through:
- Environment variables for deployment-specific settings
- Configuration files for development-time settings
- Default values built into the utility functions

## Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization
All utility functions must:
- Sanitize string inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Limit input sizes to prevent memory exhaustion
- Encode/decode data appropriately

### Error Information
Error messages must:
- Not expose sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- Provide enough detail for debugging
- Be logged appropriately for security monitoring
- Follow consistent formatting

### Access Control
Utility functions must:
- Respect existing access control mechanisms
- Not bypass security checks
- Validate permissions for sensitive operations
- Log security-relevant events

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
Utility functions must:
- Minimize memory allocation in hot paths
- Clean up resources appropriately
- Avoid memory leaks
- Handle large datasets efficiently

### Processing Time
Utility functions must:
- Meet performance targets (<200ms p95 for API operations)
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Minimize blocking operations
- Provide progress feedback for long operations

### Caching Strategy
Utility functions may implement caching for:
- Expensive API calls
- Computationally intensive operations
- Frequently accessed data
- Results that don't change often

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
All utility functions must:
- Log important events and state changes
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Not log sensitive information

### Metrics
Utility functions should collect metrics for:
- Execution time and success rates
- Error rates and types
- Resource usage (memory, CPU)
- Cache hit/miss ratios

### Tracing
Utility functions should support:
- Distributed tracing for complex operations
- Request correlation across multiple calls
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Debugging of complex workflows
