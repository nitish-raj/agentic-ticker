# Archive Summary

This directory contains files that were archived during the cleanup of the Agentic Ticker project to remove old configuration files, documentation, and other files that are no longer needed in the new architecture.

## Archive Structure

### `old_application_files/`
Contains old application files from the previous architecture:
- `agentic_ticker.py` - Original monolithic Streamlit application
- `demo_duplication_system.py` - Demo file for the code duplication detection system
- `unified_app.py` - Old unified application file that is no longer used

### `old_documentation/`
Contains documentation that is no longer relevant to the new architecture:
- `CODE_DUPLICATION_SYSTEM.md` - Documentation for the code duplication detection system from the old architecture
- `FASTAPI_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of FastAPI integration from the previous implementation
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Migration guide for the backward compatibility layer that is no longer needed

### `old_configuration/`
Contains old configuration files:
- `launch.json` - Old VS Code debug configuration that is no longer needed

### `old_api_files/`
Contains old API files that have been replaced by the new modular architecture:
- `api.py` - Standalone FastAPI application (doesn't use new modular structure)
- `unified_launcher.py` - Launcher script for unified application

### `tests/`
Contains old test files that are no longer relevant:
- `run_contract_tests.py` - Old contract test runner
- `test_api.py` - Old API test file
- `test_api_direct.py` - Old direct API test file
- `test_duplication_api.py` - Old duplication API test file
- `test_duplication_integration.py` - Old duplication integration test file
- `test_progress_tracker.py` - Old progress tracker test file

## Files That Were Kept

The following files were preserved as they are part of the new architecture:

### Configuration Files
- `src/config.py` - New configuration system
- `config.example.json` - Example JSON configuration
- `config.example.yaml` - Example YAML configuration

### Documentation
- `docs/` directory containing all new documentation:
  - `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
  - `CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md`
  - `PERFORMANCE_BENCHMARKS.md`
  - `QUICK_START.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `REFACTORING_PROGRESS_TRACKING.md`
  - `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
  - `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`

### API Files
- ~~`api.py` - New FastAPI implementation~~ (ARCHIVED - moved to old_api_files/)
- ~~`unified_launcher.py` - New unified launcher for both UI and API~~ (ARCHIVED - moved to old_api_files/)

### Setup Files
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `setup.cfg` - Package configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variables example

## Purpose

This archive serves as a reference for historical purposes and can be safely deleted if the old files are no longer needed. The new architecture provides a cleaner, more modular approach with better organization and maintainability.
